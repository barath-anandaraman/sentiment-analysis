### Entity-Level Sentiment Analysis 
#### Synopsis: 
Granular Insights from Textual Data
This repository contains resources and code related to Entity-Level Sentiment Analysis (ELSA), a powerful technique that moves beyond general sentiment to understand specific opinions.

Traditional sentiment analysis might tell you if a review is positive or negative overall. ELSA, however, identifies distinct entities (e.g., product names, brands, individuals, specific features) within text and determines the sentiment directed specifically at each one.

Why is this crucial?

Without ELSA, businesses often face significant challenges:

Misinterpreting overall sentiment, leading to ineffective strategies.
Difficulty monitoring brand reputation at a granular level.
Shallow understanding of customer feedback, hindering product improvements.
Inaccurate campaign performance tracking.
Incomplete competitive analysis.
By providing highly granular and actionable insights, ELSA empowers organizations to make data-driven decisions, refine product development, enhance customer satisfaction, and gain a precise understanding of public perception towards their most critical assets.
